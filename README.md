# Evoastra Internship - Data Analysis Projects

## Overview

This repository contains hands-on projects completed during my internship at **Evoastra**. The experience involved working remotely with a team of interns to build real-world data solutions, focusing on scraping, cleaning, and analyzing datasets.



## Internship Highlights

- Remote-first collaborative learning environment
- Individual and team-based task execution
- Practical exposure to real-world data projects


## Project Structure

### Task 1: Mini Project – Web Scraping of MG Cars (Cars24)

**Objective**  
To scrape used MG car listings from [Cars24](https://www.cars24.com/buy-used-mg-cars-mumbai/) for data analysis.

**Features Scraped**:
- Manufacture Year
- Car Title
- Variant
- Kilometers Driven
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Ownership Type
- Price
- Location

**Tools Used**:
- Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests
- Pandas for data storage and formatting

**Files**:
- Notebook: [`web_scraping_mg_cars.ipynb`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/Task%201/Mini%20Project/web_scraping_mg_cars.ipynb)
- Raw Dataset: [`mg_cars_mumbai_raw.csv`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/Task%201/Mini%20Project/mg_cars_mumbai_raw.csv)

### Task 2: Major Project – Data Analysis

**Objective**  
To perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive insights from the dataset.

**Steps Involved**:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics and visualizations

**Tools Used**:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter / Colab notebooks

**Files**:
- Notebook: [`EDA.ipynb`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)
- Cleaned Dataset: [`cleaned_data.csv`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/DataSets/cleaned_data.csv)


## Team Reports
